                       If you are in search of an original idea for starting your own business, but are not ready to take risks, you are on the right track! Becoming a partner of Era-Auto, you can open your own multi-brand auto parts store with minimal investment! Buying a franchise guarantees a quick start and payback in the shortest possible time. BUT! It is important to understand that any business requires attention, especially at the very beginning: concentrating resources not only on the quality of service, but also on promotion, both online and offline - the car will not go without fuel, unless it is a short distance from the hill. You can also say about the franchise of auto parts and about any other franchise - when buying a ready-made business, it is important to understand what needs to be invested in its promotion. Technical and mentoring support, reputation promotion and CEO are behind us, but if you want to grow, you need to declare yourself on different online and offline platforms: Yandex.Direct, Google.Advertising, SMM, depending on geography, the radio can work well. Do not forget about wholesale buyers of auto parts: we recommend after purchasing a franchise from us, conclude an agreement for the supply of auto parts with car services, taxi fleets, freight forwarders with your own fleet, etc. On all these and other issues, our consulting service will always provide assistance and support.

                   <p>
                   You do not need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of competitors, from scratch to develop a development plan, look for a programmer and designer, buy an engine, rent spare parts catalogs and spend time and effort on a host of other little things that need to be foreseen. Becoming a partner of our federal company with more than a decade of experience in the sale of spare parts, you will receive a ready-made 100% revenue-generating business.
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>
                       We are all set. An hour after signing the contract with your first supplier, you can start selling spare parts online for any cars, both trucks and cars, as well as for special equipment.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       Conditions are such that we do not require percent of sales and not to drive franchisee in tough conditions. Only you decide what your pricing policy will be. And we, for our part, will always support you with advice, including on opening an offline store, and share the secrets of the success of our partners in different cities of the country

                       <li>
                       The price of the auto parts franchise is not high - it depends on the population. Once you pay a fee for entering the auto parts market under the well-known brand Era-Auto, and this amount is used to cover our expenses for opening your store. You are given a grace period while you are “entering” the business: at this time you need to determine the store’s address, work schedule and contact details for working with customers, as well as register a legal entity (in the absence of spare parts at the time of purchase). In the future, small monthly deductions will follow, aimed at the technical development and maintenance of the site, as well as the promotion of your online store.
                       </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>
                   Important! Unlike many companies offering cooperation on franchising terms, we are not aimed at instantly receiving money for the fact of partnership. We want our company to grow, and you grow and develop with it. Therefore, we create the most comfortable conditions for the franchisee.
